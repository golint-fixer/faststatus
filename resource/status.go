// Status represents how busy a given resource is on a scale from 0â€“2,
// where 0 (Free) is a completely unoccupied resource, 2 (Occupied) is
// completely occupied, and 1 (Busy) is anything between. The simplicity
// and flexibility of this scheme allows this to be used for any number
// of applications.
